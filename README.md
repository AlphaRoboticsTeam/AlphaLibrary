# Arduino + TCA Project

This project is designed to make it easier to use Arduino with the *TCA module.

## Features
# tcaselect function:
-  Helps to easily use this module.  
# Alphaboard:
- Starts the program with a button.  
# Alphamotors: You can provide 3 main pins and it will create 3 functions for motors.  
# Servo function: Works with a pin and a given angle.  
# MPU function: Provide the TCA channel, and get different angles and gyro values.  
# Ultrasonic class: Only requires two pins, trigger and echo.
